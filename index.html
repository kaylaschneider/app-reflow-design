<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>WeatherBug has been know to be a reliable weather app and has many unique features that set it apart from others. WeatherBug has a lightning detection element and allows users to set push notifications for severe weather updates and an option to add a widget to cell phone homepages . Along with a mobile app, WeatherBug also has a desktop interface. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After using WeatherBug for many years, I have found myself more and more frustrated with the design of the app. Quite frankly, the only reason I still use it is because of how reliable the weather predictions are compared to other weather apps. I found that many other WeatherBug users share the same frustrations. </p>

<h3 id="app-analysis">App Analysis</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The screenshots below show what the current homepage of WeatherBug looks like. The only navigation is vertical scrolling. In my opinion, there is a lot of useless content contributing to the excessive amount of scrolling; while it might be interesting, it doesn't necessarily belong on the homepage. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a lot of featured videos, and while I think they are interesting, I think they need their own space. The homepage should be simple, easy to read, and straight to the point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, WeatherBug does not have a universal menu at the bottom of the app to easily switch between pages, which I think is an important thing to consider with the amount of content on the app. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My goal of this case study is to analyze the current conditions of this app, conduct research to understand other perspectives form users, and design a new look and flow to improve the user experience of the app. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To fully understand user's frustrations with WeatherBug, I created a Google form and shared it with a few group chats and on my social media platforms. I asked some basic questions about what users want to have on the homepage of their weather app, and some questions to fully understand the user's experience with WeatherBug. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I received 26 responses on my survey and was able to gain a better understanding of the user's experiences and develop some ideas to change the look and flow of WeatherBug's homepage. </p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="pain-point-1">Pain Point #1:</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first pain point is that there is overall too much content on the homepage of WeatherBug. A lot of the content presented might be interesting, however it does not necessarily belong on the home page of the app. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="pain-point-2">Pain Point #2:</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second pain point could ultimately be resolved by fixing the first pain point. There is an excessive amount of scrolling required to view content on the homepage of WeatherBug. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How might we improve the design of WeatherBug's homepage to improve the user experience? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>My first goal in designing the reflow of this app is to minimize the amount of content on the homepage. </li><li>My second goal is to reduce the amount of vertical scrolling on the homepage by adding previews that are clickable and will redirect users to the content they want to see. Ideally, users would be able to customize the content they have on their personal homepage so they can see the information that they are interested in.</li></ol>

<h3 id="the-redesign">The Redesign</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After taking all of the results of the research survey into consideration, I was able to come up with a few goals in re-designing the flow of the WeatherBug homepage. Most importantly, The amount of content on the page should be minimal and only the necessities. After minimizing the amount of content on the homepage, the excessive amount of scrolling the app had now, should ideally no longer be an issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
<h4 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started my redesign by hand drawing a wireframe keeping in mind a sense of information hierarchy. I also drew up two potential WeatherBug homepage layouts. Using the poll of what users wanted to see, I was able to get most of the information on one page, but ideally, users would be able to customize what they want to see.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the homepage, users will be able to view all of the important weather information, and easily access more detailed pages of the hourly and daily forecasts. I implemented a universal navigation menu at the bottom of the page for easy access to other tabs. One of the navigations at the bottom takes users to a page dedicated to all of the featured videos that were once on the homepage of WeatherBug.  Users can also access the hourly and daily forecasts and radar maps from the bottom navigation, as well as easy access back to the homepage of the app. </p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While this flow seems simple, many changed were made and by minimizing the amount of content and simplifying the navigation around the app, my hope is that the overall user experience has improved. . </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This project was very helpful in learning more about UX design and how to analyze user research. I hope to apply these skills when working with businesses to help them improve the user experience of their websites and apps. </p>
